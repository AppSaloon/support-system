uCare is the ultimate WordPress plugin to create a fully-featured support ticket help desk system for your business. With unique user roles
for your support admins, agents and customers, you can provide your customers with a unique and impressive support experience
which is aimed at increasing customser satisfaction. 

uCare allows you to work on customer support tickets directly from the backend or the frontend. You can view, manage and comment on tickets, as well as update ticket status directly from the WordPress
dashboard. Additionally, you and the support agents will be able to use the beautifully designed page to work on tickets.

This plugin creates it's own page that runs completely seperate from your theme, meaning this is the only plugin that has zero impact on your
site speed, as none of the assets get loaded to your site, unless the user is on the help desk page. It also uses a tabbed-system for viewing tickets. Meaning, you can open multiple tickets and work on them at the same time.
The front-end is fully using Ajax, no loading, everything updates while you're on the page.

The frontend app is fully responsive, and is coded in a way to use as little resource as possible, ensuring it always runs super fast.
